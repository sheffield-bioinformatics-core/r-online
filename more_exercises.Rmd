# The Dataset

We will illustrate some of the main functions from tidyverse with example data from [COSMIC](https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic). An example file is freely available, but you will need to register for full-size file. This is an archive of files. Each has 100 lines of the the full files (that you have to register to access)

`download.file` is an R *function* for downloading a file into your *working directory* (the directory where R is currently looking to open files from, and save files to).

```{r eval=FALSE}
download.file("https://cog.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/taster/example_grch38_cosmic.tar",destfile = "example_grch38_cosmic.tar")
```

We use R function, `untar` to extract files from the archive. You should see that a `cosmic_example` directory has been created.

```{r eval=FALSE}
untar(tarfile = "example_grch38_cosmic.tar",exdir="cosmic_example")
```

We import data so that we can analyse it in R using one of the various functions that are called `read_..`. The choice depends on the type of file (csv, tsv, etc...)

# Exercise1

<div class="exercise">

- Which function from `readr` would you use the read the file `CosmicMutantExport.tsv` into R?
- Import the file `CosmicMutantExport.tsv` into R
- How many rows and columns are in the data frame you create

</div>

```{r}

cosmic <- readr::read_tsv("cosmic_example/CosmicMutantExport.tsv")

```

# Exercise2

Practice using the `select` function 

<div class="exercise">

- Select the last five columns from the table
- Select all columns that contain information on the tumour Histology
-

</div>
