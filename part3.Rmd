# Introduction to R - Part III

## Recap

```{r message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
gapminder <- read_csv("raw_data/gapminder.csv")
```


# Summarising and grouping with dplyr

The `summarise` function can take any R function that takes a vector of values (i.e. a column from a data frame) and returns a single value. Some of the more useful functions include:

- `min` minimum value
- `max` maximum value
- `sum` sum of values
- `mean` mean value
- `sd` standard deviation
- `median` median value
- `IQR` the interquartile range
- `n_distinct` the number of distinct values
- `n` the number of observations (Note: this is a special function that doesnâ€™t take a vector argument, i.e. column)


```{r}
summarise(gapminder, min(lifeExp), max(gdpPercap), mean(pop))
```

It is also possible to summarise using a function that takes more than one value, i.e. from multiple columns. For example, we could compute the correlation between year and life expectancy. Here we also assign names to the table that is produced.

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
summarise(MinLifeExpectancy = min(lifeExp), 
          MaximumGDP = max(gdpPercap), 
          AveragePop = mean(pop), 
          Correlation = cor(year, lifeExp))
```

However, it is not particularly useful to calculate such values from the entire table as we have different continents and years. The `group_by` function allows us to split the table into different categories, and compute summary statistics for each year (for example).

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
    group_by(year) %>% 
    summarise(MinLifeExpectancy = min(lifeExp), 
              MaximumGDP = max(gdpPercap), 
              AveragePop = mean(pop))
```

If we want to summarise several columns we can use the convenient `summarise_all` function. However, this will return `NA` values for columns that do not contain numeric values.

```{r warning=FALSE}
gapminder %>% 
  group_by(continent,year) %>% 
  summarise_all(mean)
```



The nice thing about `summarise` is that it can followed up by any of the other `dplyr` verbs that we have met so far (`select`, `filter`, `arrange`..etc). 

Returning to the correlation between life expectancy and year, we can summarise as follows:-

```{r}
gapminder %>%     
    group_by(country) %>% 
    summarise(Correlation = cor(year , lifeExp))
```
We can then arrange the table by the correlation to see which countries have the lowest correlation

```{r}
gapminder %>%      
    group_by(country) %>% 
    summarise(Correlation = cor(year , lifeExp)) %>% 
    arrange(Correlation)
```

We can filter the results to find obsevations of interest

```{r}
gapminder %>%      
    group_by(country) %>% 
    summarise(Correlation = cor(year , lifeExp)) %>% 
    filter(Correlation < 0)
```

The countries we identify could then be used as the basis for a plot.

```{r}
filter(gapminder, country %in% c("Rwanda","Zambia","Zimbabwe")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=lifeExp,col=country)) + geom_line()
```

### Exercise 

- Produce a plot to show the change in average `gdpPercap` for each continent over time.
- see below for a suggestion
    + HINT: you will need to specifiy the `geom_col` function to create the bar plot

# Joining

In many real life situations, data are spread across multiple tables or spreadsheets. Usually this occurs because different types of information about a subject, e.g. a patient, are collected from different sources. It may be desirable for some analyses to combine data from two or more tables into a single data frame based on a common column, for example, an attribute that uniquely identifies the subject.

`dplyr` provides a set of join functions for combining two data frames based on matches within specified columns. For those familiar with such SQL, these operations are very similar to carrying out join operations between tables in a relational database.

As a toy example, lets consider two data frames that contain the names of various bands, and the instruments that they play:-
```{r}
band_instruments
band_members
```

There are various ways in which we can join these two tables together. We will just consider the case of a "left join".

`left_join` returns all rows from the first data frame regardless of whether there is a match in the second data frame. Rows with no match are included in the resulting data frame but have NA values in the additional columns coming from the second data frame.

Animations to illustrate other types of join are available at [https://github.com/gadenbuie/tidy-animated-verbs](https://github.com/gadenbuie/tidy-animated-verbs)

```{r}
left_join(band_members, band_instruments)
```
`right_join` is similar but returns all rows from the second data frame that have a match with rows in the first data frame based on the specified column.

```{r}
right_join(band_members, band_instruments)
```

`inner_join` only returns those rows where matches could be made

```{r}
inner_join(band_members, band_instruments)
```

### Exercise (open-ended)

- Data for global COVID-19 cases are available online from CSSE at Johns Hopkins University on their github repository
- Download these data to your computer (URL below)
- Transform these data into "long" format for analysis using the `gather` function from the `tidyr` package
- Explore the data and generate some plots you may have seen in the media
    + e.g. trajectory of cases over time
- Join to the `gapminder` dataset to scale the number of cases by population size

covid <- read_csv("time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv") %>% 
  rename(country = `Country/Region`) %>% 
  tidyr::gather(Date, Cases, 5:72)

```
