# Part 1 Solution

Load the readr library and read the gapminder raw data

```{r}
library(readr)
## check that the file is present
file.exists("raw_data/gapminder.csv")
gapminder <- read_csv("raw_data/gapminder.csv")

```

Print last 10 rows of the table using the tail function. The argument n needs to be changed from the default

```{r}
# the argument n changes the number of rows that are printed
tail(gapminder,n=10)
```

What is the largest population? We can access the pop column using the $ symbol

```{r}
# advisable to use tab-completion to avoid typos
max(gapminder$pop)
```

What is the lowest life expectancy?

```{r}
min(gapminder$lifeExp)
```
